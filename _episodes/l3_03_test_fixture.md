## 1. Brief Introduction of Test Fixtures
A test fixture, in the context of unit testing, refers to the preparation and configuration needed to run a set of test cases. It includes the setup of the test environment, the creation of necessary objects or resources, and the cleanup steps after the tests are executed. Test fixtures help ensure that the tests are performed in a controlled and consistent environment, providing reliable and reproducible results.

In GoogleTest, a test fixture is implemented using a test fixture class. This class serves as a container for shared setup and cleanup logic, as well as any shared objects or resources required by the test cases within the fixture.
### 1.1 When is a Test Fixture Needed?
A test fixture is typically used in the following scenarios:

1. **Shared Setup and Teardown**: When multiple test cases require a common set of setup or teardown (which means cleaning in general and is the opposite of setup) steps, a test fixture is beneficial. Instead of duplicating the setup and teardown code in each test case, we can define it once in the test fixture and reuse it across all the tests.

2. **Reducing Code Duplication**: Test fixtures help in reducing code duplication. By encapsulating the common setup and teardown logic within a fixture, we avoid duplicating the same code in multiple test cases. This improves code maintainability and reduces the chances of errors due to inconsistent or incomplete setup/teardown.

3. **Isolation and Independence**: Test fixtures provide a level of isolation and independence for each test case. Each test case within a fixture runs in its own instance of the fixture class, ensuring that changes made by one test case do not affect the others. This allows for parallel execution of test cases without interference.

Let us understand how to create a test fixture, setup and teardown functions with examples.
