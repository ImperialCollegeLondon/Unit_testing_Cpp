## Delivery of the course

Material will be delivered as a lecture with task following the Carpentries teaching
style.

- The instructor will walk you through the theoretical material of the course,
  demonstrating the execution of the relevant code and instructions. **You are highly encouraged to
  code along** and execute the instructions at the same time.
- Throughout the lessons, there are **yellow boxes** highlighting particularly challenging
  or important concepts.
- There are also exercises in **orange boxes**. The instructor will give you time to try
  to do them yourself before going through the solution. This is often available in a
  folded part of the orange box, so you can check it at any time.
- When doing exercises, put a green sticker in your computer whenever you are done, or a
  pink/orange one if you need support. A helper will go to you.
- For online sessions, raise your hand if you are done with the exercise and write
 any questions or problems directly into the chat, so a helper can try to solve it.
